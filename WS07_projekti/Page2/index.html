          Early on in my life we had a computer at home and I could see my
          brothers using it for games and other stuff that I didn't understand
          at the time. Me and my friend played browser games via Flash on sites
          like Miniclip, Nitrome and Y8. These games sparked my interest in
          computers and technology.

        <p>
          At the start of my elementary school years I went to a liberary where
          they had computersthat could be used by the public. There I met new
          friends and really got into playing games online and first games that
          I really got into were Tanki Online and Transformice. In elementary
          school we had computer classes where we learned basic computer skills
          like typing, using a mouse and basic programs like Powerpoint and
          Word. On 3rd grade I got a PS3 and started playing games like
          Battlefield Bad Company 2, Little Big Planet, Granturismo 5, Minecraft
          and GTA once it came out. Sometime during elementary school I got my
          first laptop which was a Windows 10 HP laptop.

          I bought a used desktop PC my first programming was actually in
          Middleschool where I had a course in Skratch programming and then
          myself tried to learn Python via YouTube tutorials, but I didnt get
          very far back then. I also started learning waching videos of basic
          Machine Learning projects of others and coding, but didnt do much
          myself. I also got more into gaming and started playing games like
          League of Legends and CS:GO.

          I started studying IT and got more serious about learning programming.
          I built my first PC with parts that I bought myself and learned a lot
          about hardware and stresstesting.
