          <a href="../WS07_projekti/Page2/index.html"><h3>Computers</h3></a>
        <p>Computers and the internet have given me the passions I have and given me wasts ammounts of knowledge.
            I have personally had to fix issues regarding routers, pcs and other devices. I ranked this subject high because
            it has made me come towards the path of IT which I am studuing. I have also become an IT support for some of my family members as a side effect.

        <a href="Page3/index.html"><h3>Video Games</h3></a>
        <p>Videogames are a strong reason for the mindset that I have. My logical thinking came from coming up with strategies in competetive Games
            and it also made me learn Enlish, which I was quite awful at when I was younger. Video games have also made me become closer to my friends.
